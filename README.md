# Final-Project-Ironhack

For the final project @Ironhack I tried to predict the music-genre of a random song using the audio features spotify provides. <br>

Since this is an supervised machine learning approach (SL), it is necessary to have data with songs and their audio features and additional the genre of each song. <br>
Therefore I used the spotipy API to: <br>
- scrape thousands of songs and their audio features <br>
- retrieve the genre of each song via the artist or the album (the genre on spotify is only connected via the artist or the album of a song) <br>
